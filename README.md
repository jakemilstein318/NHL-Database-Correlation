# NHL-Database-Correlation
This project takes two separate datasets in regards to the New York Rangers hockey team and finds a correlation between them. One dataset, which comes from statista.com, displays information on the amount of goals scored and goals allowed per home game during the span of the 2017 season-2020 season. The second database, which comes from hockey-reference.com, displays information on the amount of fans in attendance and the number of vacant seats per home game. My hypothesis was that there would be a strong correlation between the number of fans in attendance and the game performance of the New York Rangers, but my analysis proved otherwise.
